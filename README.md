## Features 🔍

- **🎨 Personalized Recommendations**: Users receive movie suggestions based on their past ratings.
- **🔍 Movie Search**: Search movies by title and view detailed information.
- **⚙️ Collaborative Filtering**: Recommendations based on the behavior of similar users.
- **📊 Content-Based Filtering**: Recommendations based on the content of the movies (e.g., genre, keywords).
- **🎥 Movie Posters**: Display movie posters fetched from the TMDb API.
- **🔧 User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an interactive and easy-to-use web interface.

## Technologies Used 🚀

- **💻 Python**: For the backend logic and data processing.
- **🎮 Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application.
- **🔢 Pandas**: For handling and processing large datasets.
- **⚖️ Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms like cosine similarity.
- **🎥 TMDb API**: For fetching movie posters and additional metadata.
- **🔐 Pickle**: For saving and loading pre-trained models and processed data.

## How It Works ✨

1. **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses user-item interaction data to recommend movies that similar users have liked.
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses movie features like genre, cast, and keywords to recommend movies similar to the ones a user has rated highly.
3. **Integration with TMDb API**: Fetches movie posters and metadata to enhance the user experience.
